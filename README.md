# ALX Frontend for Fun

This repository contains several frontend tasks focused on enhancing CSS skills through practical implementations. Each task involves creating specific CSS styles for predefined HTML structures.

## Project Structure

- `0-styles.css`: CSS styles for creating a sprite layout.
- `1-styles.css`: CSS styles for creating an underline animation that appears slowly when hovered.
- `2-styles.css`: CSS styles for creating a custom toggle switch.
- `3-styles.css`: CSS styles for creating an animated circular menu.

## Task Descriptions

### 0. Sprite Layout
**File:** `0-styles.css`

This task involves creating a sprite layout where different icons are displayed using a single image sprite. The HTML structure is provided, and the goal is to position the correct part of the sprite for each icon.

### 1. Underline Animation
**File:** `1-styles.css`

This task focuses on creating an underline that is hidden by default and slowly appears when a link is hovered over. The challenge is to achieve this effect using CSS transitions.

### 2. Custom Toggle Switch
**File:** `2-styles.css`

In this task, you will create a custom toggle switch using only CSS. The HTML structure includes a checkbox input, and the goal is to style it to look like a modern toggle switch with an on/off state.

### 3. Animated Circular Menu
**File:** `3-styles.css`

This task involves creating a circular menu that expands and contracts when the user interacts with it. The HTML structure includes a central button and several menu items that need to animate outward when the button is toggled.

## Usage

To view and test these styles, simply open the respective HTML files in your browser. Each HTML file is linked to its corresponding CSS file.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS3** for styling and animations.
- **Font Awesome** for iconography in the circular menu.
